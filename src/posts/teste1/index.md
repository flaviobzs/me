> How the influence of many professionals have helped me to become what I am today.

Many factors can influence on how we overcome obstacles in our life. Such challenges normally happen when we face many uncertainties, hence, providing us with choices that can change how our life can turn out to be.

Many of our victories can be dedicated to all the mentors we have known throughout our lives who have somehow helped to guide the path we have decided to pursue without asking for anything in return. Subliminally, with many times the desire to see you overcome your obstacles and walk a path to success.

A simple gesture of effort to show how something works, a minute to suggest something to read, an encouraging lecture to never give up, or even advice to avoid doing such things. All of this contributes to the way we think and how we can plan what we want for our future.

## For those who don't know where to go, should any destination be good?

I remember just like it was yesterday, the day I got to play with my `first` computer. I've been always a curious guy for many things, especially when it had to do with technology. My dad's friend helped me configuring everything and I started using/learning as much as I could.

For a long time, this friend helped us to format/install our computer when it was slow or abducted by v√≠ruses (LOL). That was the time I started thinking about doing that as a professional.

I learned with a friend, the step-by-step of how to install and configure a computer, and it got me very interested about how everything worked. With eleven years old, I deciede that I wanted to study way more thant I was able at that time. Nothing was easy when you're a fella who lives in a small city, which is also located in a small state. Believe or not, I could find myself waiting until midnight, so I could start using internet with my Old fashion moden. For many years I was the little IT kid in the block, that never stopped me to have dreams about something bigger.

Sometimes I keep thinking about what would have happened If I haven't had met those people that for sure had a big influence in my life to keep porsuing more knowledge. Have you stopped to think about what would _you_ be without people like that in your life?

Nowadays many people don't know what to do before they start a degree in a university. Usually when they think about something, they are not really sure of what is the real meaning or what happen in a profession.

Informally I was influenced by people close to me, but not everyone is so lucky. I hope one day it will be better introduced in our education system.

## Sometimes we just need a little push
